Custom error handling used for the cog and the API

If you need to prevent and exception, do it like this

.. code-block:: python

    errors = bot.get_cog('RoleInvite').errors

    try:
        await api.add_invite(
            ctx.guild, 'main', [42]
        )
    except errors.CannotAddRole:
        print("Missing permissions")
    except InviteNotFound:
        print("Invalid invite")
    except:
        # occurs for any exception
        print("Fatal error")
    else:
        # executed if the try succeeded
        print("All good")
    finally:
        # always executed
        print("End of function")
